# Language Translator

## Overview
Language Translator is a simple application built with Python and Streamlit. It provides users with the ability to translate text between different languages using either speech recognition or text input. The application utilizes the Google Translate API for translation and the gTTS library for text-to-speech conversion.

## Features
- **Speech Recognition**: Translate spoken language into text and then into the desired target language.
- **Text Input**: Directly input text for translation.
- **Language Selection**: Supports translation between a wide range of languages.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Convert translated text into speech for auditory feedback.
- **Translation History**: Keep track of translations made during the session.
